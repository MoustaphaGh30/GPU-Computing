(1) Assume that a block/tile dimension of 32x32 is used. What is the ratio of
    floating point operations to bytes loaded from global memory performed by
    each of the following kernels? Show your work.

    (a) The kernel implemented in the previous assignment (without shared memory
        tiling)
		We performed 2 FP operations (multiplying A[..] and B[...])
		and adding them to the sum. 

		We loaded two FP numbers (8 Bytes) 

		resulting in 0.25 OP/Byte
		

    (b) The kernel implemented in this assignment (with shared memory tiling)

		K/32 * 2 floating point entries are being loaded each time by each
		thread and preforming 2*K operations 
		resulting in 4 OP/Bytes		




(2) Assume that a block/tile size of 32x32 is used, and that the program runs
    on a NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU (the model on the HPC cluster) which has the
    following resource constraints:
        > 2048 max threads/SM
        > 32 max blocks/SM
        > 96KB max shared-memory/SM
        > 64K max registers/SM
    Note that you can extract the resource usage of your kernel, including
    registers/thread and shared-memory/block using the folloing command:
                nvcc -c --ptxas-options="-v" kernel.cu
    Answer the following questions about occupancy for the kernel implemented
    in this assignment. Show your work.

    (a) Is occupancy limited by the max blocks/SM?
	 

	Each block comprises 32*32 threads, totaling 1024 threads per block, and the maximum number of threads per SM is 2048, we can allocate 2 blocks per SM. This falls below the maximum limit of 32 blocks per SM, indicating that the occupancy is not constrained by the maximum blocks per SM.




    (b) Is occupancy limited by the max shared-memory/SM?

	Assuming we have 2 blocks per SM, each with 1024 threads, totaling 2048 threads per SM, and each thread loads 0.25*K bytes, for shared memory per SM to constrain us, K/32 should be greater than 384,000. Therefore, it's unlikely to be limited by shared memory per SM. 



    (c) Is occupancy limited by the max registers/SM?


	each SM requires 2048 * 33 registers, totaling 75,584 registers per SM. This exceeds the maximum number of registers per SM, which is 64,000. Hence, the occupancy is limited by the maximum registers per SM.
