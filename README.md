# GPU Computing

## Outcomes:

1. Describe GPU architectures and compare them to CPU architectures
2. Design a parallel algorithm for a given sequential algorithm
3. Develop a GPU kernel that implements a given parallel algorithm
4. Reason about the efficiency of a GPU kernel, identify its performance bottlenecks, and apply
optimizations to improve its performance
